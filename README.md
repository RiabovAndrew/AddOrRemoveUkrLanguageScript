# Add/Remove ukrainian language script

### - What does this script do?
### - Add/Remove ukrainian language to/from your keyboard layout language bar
### - And how to use it?
### - So...
- put all four files in one folder on your pc
- click on `add uk lang.bat` or `remove uk lang.bat` to process an appropriate action

Requirements:
- it works on windows pc with powershell only

Note how to make it more convenient:
- create link to `add uk lang.bat` or `remove uk lang.bat` file inside any folder
- RMC(right mouse click) -> properties -> windows -> choose minimized window

So now you can use the link and cmd will not make any splaches on screen.
